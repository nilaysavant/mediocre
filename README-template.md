# Mediocre Editor

Desktop App boilerplate/template using [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/). Uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for frontend.

- Added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- View [Readme](./README-CRA.md).

## Communication between frontend(TS/JS) and backend(RUST)

- [Using Rust Commands](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/usage/guides/command): This is the currently implemented way.

## Issues

- `*.svg` assets do not work with **Tauri** atm. Use `*.png` instead. [Tauri Issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/1515).
