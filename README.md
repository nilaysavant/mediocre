## Note from Author

Hey ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for coming by!

There have been a lot of learnings since I started this project. Therefore I'd like to rebuild on this later down the line.

**Please do not take this for any serious use as its unsupported in its current state. Feel free try it out otherwise!**

Your feedback would be highly appreciated. Thanks!
